# BoggleBot
Multiplayer Boggle bot, built with discord.js.

## About

Boggle is a word search game you can play with your friends.

Each player has **2 minutes** to search for words that can be constructed from the letters of neighbouring squares in a provided Boggle grid, be it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally neighboring.

When a player finds a word in the grid, they enter the word in chat. If no one else has entered the word yet, the player earns points based on the number of letters in the word. Otherwise, no points will be awarded to the player.
